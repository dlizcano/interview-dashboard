12:14
Hi, good morning everyone.

12:17
Thank you for joining.

12:18
We're going to wait a few more minutes because we're supposed to have a few more Rangers joining the discussion.

21:09
Very.

21:22
Good morning.

21:41
Hi.

21:41
Good morning everyone.

21:43
Again, sorry for the the delay in starting.

21:46
Hi, Ivana.

21:48
Thank you for joining.

21:49
Yeah, good morning, Diana.

21:50
Happy to be here for the short notice.

21:54
I think we were expecting around 8 to 10 Rangers, but I'm only seeing 4.

22:00
Do you know if others would be joining?

22:20
Hi Dana.

22:21
Let me, I'm talking with Anupa now to find out where the others are and I'll get back to you.

22:27
Just give me a minute.

22:29
OK?

22:29
Sure, thank you.

22:33
I'm here with my team from KMP that morning, everyone.

22:38
Hi, Francisco.

22:40
Good morning.

22:43
How are you?

22:45
I'm good.

22:46
How are you?

22:46
I'm excited about the meeting.

22:51
Oh, well, that makes me excited to to hear.

22:57
Is anyone else in KMPA joining?

23:01
Not virtually, but everybody can hear you.

23:03
Oh, OK, OK.

23:11
I think while we, I guess while we wait for Ivana to confirm if others are joining, I don't know if you guys want to go ahead and maybe introduce yourself because I'm not so much familiar with, I'll go first, but I'm not so, so much familiar with the Rangers from Shell Beach and I don't know if any are joining from Kite.

23:32
Sure.

23:33
So my name is Dan Fnans.

23:35
I'm a technical officer with WWF Ganas.

23:39
I support WWF strategy for oceans and landscapes.

23:56
Hi, good morning, Diane.

23:58
My name is more citizens.

24:00
I'm from Ronald in South.

24:03
I am a Ranger for kind of promoting protected area and we work with protected area solution.

24:10
Thank you.

24:13
Nice to meet you.

24:15
Thank you for joining.

24:18
Good morning, everyone.

24:20
My name is Jenkins Lawrence from Yupukari.

24:22
I'm a Ranger working with the protected area's Commission at kind of and protected area.

24:28
Thank you.

24:33
Good morning.

24:35
I'm Michael McDonald from Parsha Village, working as a Ranger here.

24:39
All right, now the entire team listen here, but the four months will be attended virtually.

24:52
Alan, with myself, Francisco Gomez said.

24:54
Coordinator EMPA.

24:58
Hi, Diane.

25:00
Hi, Lana.

25:01
We we're not able to contact.

25:03
I'm not sure if KMP Rangers are, I'm not sure if the KMP Rangers are in signal because we're not getting on to them.

25:12
However, we're more Shelby traders are done.

25:15
Of course.

25:17
I think I could take this time to introduce myself too.

25:20
My name is Ivana Thompson and I'm a Senior Protected Areas officer managing Research and Ecological Monitoring department.

25:33
Thank you, Ivana.

25:35
Well, I, I think what we can I guess make a start after the others make introduce themselves.

25:43
I think what we can do if, if, if the opportunity arises again, we can see if we can have maybe a separate session with the Rangers from, from Kaicho, because what will happen is that this is not the final, the final discussion or consultation on, you know, the capacity building needs.

26:08
So we do have to prioritize what, what the soft skill list would look like.

26:14
So while they they they are unable to to join today, I think that we will still have an opportunity to engage with them.

26:28
So I see we have Dionne Joy, Alistair and Shakira.

26:37
Hey, good morning.

26:38
My name is Dionne Joy.

26:39
I work with the Yeah, be protective You region one.

26:43
I'm from region one of the Ranger.

26:58
Joy or Alistair or Shakira?

27:02
You want to either you could go next.

27:06
Hi, good morning everyone.

27:07
My name is Shakira Sam and I work with the Protected Areas Commission as a Ranger at the Shell Beach protected area.

27:19
Hi, good morning everyone.

27:21
My name is Joyce Tall.

27:22
I work at the Protected Areas Commission as a Ranger at the Fair Beach protected area.

27:31
Hey, good morning everyone.

27:33
My name is Alistair Henry.

27:34
I'm a Ranger.

27:35
I'm working with the Protected Areas Commission.

27:38
I'm stationed at Shell Beach and we do nearly sea turtle conservation.

27:45
Looking forward for constructive discussion.

27:49
Well, thank you all.

27:52
So I, I guess before proceeding further, would it be OK to record the session?

27:58
This this is to help me to make sure I capture your feedback accurately.

28:04
So is it OK if I, if I, if the session is recorded?

28:08
Yeah, it's OK.

28:14
OK.

28:15
Yes, it's OK.

28:17
OK.

28:17
Great.

28:20
Oh, my bad.

28:22
It was already recording.

28:25
OK, well thank you all for joining.

28:28
I assume that everyone here would have participated in the tech technical need assessment survey that that was shared.

28:40
I think Anupa was helping us to coordinate that.

28:44
So you're some of you, I think the Rangers at the at Canuka Mountains are familiar with the Amazon Sustainable Landscape project that is currently being implemented by the EPA in partnership with the Protected Areas Commission that is looking at landscape connectivity within Southern Guyana, focusing on the north of Pununi Westlands and the Kanuku Mountains protected area.

29:14
Now the Amazon Sustainable Landscape program is a as a program within the Amazon region and we have almost all the Amazon countries that are participating in this program.

29:28
It's in a phase two.

29:31
I think they're now moving to develop a phase three and the only country that's not part of Phase 2 is Venezuela, but I do believe that they would be part of phase three.

29:43
Now the whole aim or goal of the Amazon Sustainable Landscapes program is looking at protecting globally, globally significant biodiversity within this region as well as maintaining standing forests.

30:01
And one of the component of the program looks at a regional, regional component of the project looks at capacity building, knowledge management and capacity building.

30:19
So this component is specifically being led by the the World Bank.

30:26
And we all know that Rangers play a really key or important part in in maintaining protected areas.

30:36
And one of the things the project is or will be doing is looking at through the regional component of knowledge management and capacity building is basically helping to facilitate transfer of experiences and best practices among the different countries that are part of the program.

31:03
So with with the support of the World Bank and the Wildlife Conservation Society WCS, what they're currently, they're currently designing and in the process of implementing a series of knowledge exchange basically to look at building capacity of Rangers without within all of the ASL countries.

31:27
So what they've started to do is or the first part of that capacity building or capacity to to support was the training needs assessment that was you guys would have completed and the Rangers from all the other Amazon countries as well would have completed.

31:48
And it's basically for you to identify or help to prioritise what are some of those capacity needs that is missing that really is needed to help you to effectively carry out your duties.

32:05
So, so from the training needs assessment that will be done, one of the things we we wanted to do is to have what we're calling a focus group discussion, which is really looking at sort of like an in depth reflection on the, you know, the skills and get the skills and gaps identified through or within the technical needs assessment.

32:36
And basically for you to identify what sort of support is needed to address those needs.

32:43
If there's something you're not clear about or if I rambled on too long, please do not be afraid to stop and ask questions.

32:53
We want to make the session as engaging as possible.

32:57
So it's more or less of me talking and more of you talking.

33:02
So please don't hesitate to stop me if something is not clear or yeah, if you need clarification on something.

33:12
So what we're hoping to achieve with the focus group discussion, which would be we're going to have two focus group discussion.

33:22
So one focus only with Ray with the Ranger.

33:26
So this is the first one here.

33:29
And then we're going to have a second focus group discussion with the Protected Areas Commission because we're going to be working with the with the PAC to help based on the feedback we received here to a prioritize what those needs, what your needs are.

33:49
And then the idea is to have a short list of priority training topics and then key information on the content of what those topics should have.

34:02
So when we talk about training or competency training, we're, we're really looking at three parts.

34:16
So we're talking about skills, we're talking about knowledge, and we're talking about attitude.

34:21
When you look at knowledge and skills, you know that's really built through technical capacity building.

34:30
So that is like smart training, GPS training or GPS use, biodiversity monitoring.

34:41
What seems to be lacking maybe here as well as within the other countries or globally is really training on attitude.

34:51
And this is a type of training that's really seems to receive less attention.

35:00
And what you're what we're hoping to do is really trying to be able to have or to help Rangers have the right attitude, you know, in completing your task positively, professionally, ethically, not that I'm saying that you're not doing that.

35:24
Now you will tell me if you think that that is definitely an area that needs improvement is for again, is for you to tell us so because attitude is not an area that is really seems to get less attention.

35:41
What the program is looking to do or has prioritized is support towards that this particular type of training and looking at identifying different soft skills in the assessment that you would have completed.

36:00
It would have provided a list of some of what those soft skills are.

36:08
Are you, are you all with me or do you need anything clarified?

36:16
I got so far done.

36:18
OK, OK, great.

36:26
Glad to hear that.

36:29
So I guess maybe it's for me to hear a little bit from you.

36:34
I can help to remind you what's, what are some of those lists or maybe you can, if you remember from the, the survey you completed, do you remember any of the topics that was listed there as as as as capacity need?

37:12
I'll take silence as no.

37:21
So Diana, you're asking about like capacity needs, like for the specific range here.

37:25
I'm just trying to time it here because I don't see anybody contributing, but that's what you're asking.

37:32
So yes, as so the as part of the the the knowledge management and capacity building component of the project in looking at focusing on soft skills, there were a few that that was identified.

37:47
I do believe they were, they probably would have been listed in the survey that the Rangers would have completed.

37:54
So for example, looking at leadership and management, motivation, problem solving and decision making, organization, organizational management, emotional intelligence, I think there was a list of 11.

38:14
And then the idea is for if you, if the idea is for you to tell us if you know there's, if there's any missing from that list, for example, and to help us to understand what you think could be some of the content within those specific soft skills identified.

38:37
So what are some of the competency needed by Park Rangers?

38:43
Tell them perform their their duty.

38:45
Are you performing your duty at 100% or is there is there a need for improvement?

38:53
All right, I think, well, I, I would mostly leave the Rangers to answer.

38:58
So maybe after this they could chime in.

38:59
But just off the bat, one of the things that I think is needed at all these sites is a sort of building up capacity when it comes to report writing.

39:10
Because, you know, as a, a pertinent part of being a Ranger is actually going out in the field, collecting detail and so on, which they've been able to function as very well.

39:22
But the price where it comes actually coming back and taking that information.

39:25
Most of the time it's, it's headquarters responsibility now to do that and then submit it to management.

39:31
But it would be better to build a capacity all around.

39:37
So both the head part and decide by allowing them the opportunity now to be skilled in report writing.

39:45
OK, I, I, I agree.

39:51
I'm not sure if Filio has anything.

39:54
I think maybe, maybe still have, maybe the Rangers don't feel so relaxed.

40:01
So maybe we can start.

40:02
Maybe we can start maybe you telling me maybe about your duties as a Ranger.

40:13
So we have Rangers from, well, Rangers just from the KMPA and Shell Beach and.

40:20
Maybe you can tell me what are some of your duties or or your role as a Ranger for the Shell Beach protected area.

40:29
What do you do so we can start with Shell Beach?

40:43
Don't go at once, Alyssa, I don't know if you're here, if you're you're still here, but I feel like you could start.

40:57
Yes, miss, I'm still here.

40:59
Anyway, good morning again.

41:00
So some of our business that we got your current show, which is basically monitoring the which is your primary location and secondary location in which arrangers to go the route or the monitoring and the college user in which I myself suggest that reporter I think should be attended all the Rangers should do because it's not one person on the ground.

41:23
Also almost like public speaking and knowledge exchange.

41:29
I feel it plays a vital role and giving, you know, all the other Rangers a chance to at least learn something that you already know.

41:38
You know, like exchange skill and teach everyone so everybody could function as a team.

41:45
That's from my part.

41:46
I think the other, I will give the other ranges a chance to give an input as well.

41:51
So Joyce, all over to you.

41:54
So before Joy, you said public speaking and knowledge, was it knowledge exchange or communication?

42:07
Communication and knowledge exchange to some extent, communication with is it how you communicate the information, for example, to your community stakeholders or how information is communicated to you from head office?

42:31
I just want to make sure I understand when you say communication in.

42:35
I really just want to make sure I capture your, your suggestion clearly.

42:43
Yeah.

42:43
When I said communication, I mean, like from all parties because communication is a vital place, a vital role in teamwork.

42:51
And, you know, as Rangers, we work as a team.

42:53
I feel communication is one of the most important thing that you should, you should embrace while working.

42:59
You know, at least if I don't know something, I can always say, hey, Miss Diana, I don't understand it.

43:05
Please show me.

43:05
And if you have any idea of what to do, you can you can you know, achieve me so we can work.

43:10
We will get the best result, the best result possible.

43:17
OK, thank you.

43:25
Yes, Joy.

43:28
Hi, good morning again.

43:29
So some of the roles that we do as Rangers, I will start off with the first one which we do, we usually do it early and there with the sea turtle monitoring which start from February to July, where we protect these sea turtle and their eggs from poachers and predators.

43:49
And beside that we also go to the fields to do camera traps, which I'm not familiar with because I've never done camera trap before.

44:05
We also go out in every communities that are adjacent to the childish protected area to spread awareness on our work and we teach the kids.

44:14
Also we do bio walking.

44:22
So I highly recommend some trainings when it comes to bio walking because in the bio walk we have to we have to make reports on what human activities we see and also what type of animal activities.

44:43
For example, if I see a track on an animal track, I won't be able to know if this is an agouti track or whatever wild animal it could be.

44:53
So yeah.

44:59
And these are just some I will let Shakira and Dionne tell us about moreover.

45:09
Hey, good morning again.

45:12
One thing I would like to support on Joy's ideas that I buy a walk is that some of the times you have to identify like forest type, different trees and so on, which I think can be important that just to learn different trees names.

45:28
And another thing is on GPS, whereas it is very important when you're doing this by a walk, the GPS coming is very, very important.

45:37
You track mark, so on.

45:41
So I think training on GPS more, everybody have a basic idea of the GPS, but I think more in depth training will be nice.

45:51
Yeah, that's a nice part.

45:58
Hi again, everyone.

46:00
So Alistair, Joy and Dionne cover most of what we do as Ranger at Shell Beach.

46:06
So I'd say we need more public speaking training because we do a lot of consultation and outreach with people.

46:13
So I think that being more better at public speaking, it will help us to get our message better over to the people that we're teaching.

46:32
Thank you, Dionne.

46:33
Thank you, Shakira.

46:36
So what about leadership?

46:40
Is I assume Ivana, there is a site coordinator for Shell Beach as well.

46:45
Is that somebody from head office or is that somebody from the region?

47:02
Ivana is not here.

47:02
So I think you're gonna answer this Ivana.

47:04
So I say coordinator is Rajan Kumar is from region 535 Barbies.

47:12
I don't think he's on the meeting as as he speak here.

47:18
Oh, OK, Filio, yes, then I I see my ranges and and and three categories those that would have just joined with no work experience, some that joined with some work experience and those who have been on the job for for a while now.

47:54
So you'll have two categories of needs for capacity building there.

48:07
Sorry, some that so new staff you're some new started came up with some soft skills array some some from previous jobs and some that came with with with no work experience and others that would have been on the job for for a while now.

48:31
Some are four years, some are here for as much as four years already as arrangers.

48:47
Wow, very long time.

48:50
So when you when you so going back to some of the the the list.

48:55
So while it's not soft skills alone, but it's also technical skills.

48:59
So they do go hand in hand.

49:01
But I also know that and you can correct me if I'm wrong where there there is a lot or maybe a few capacity building activities, but it's provided by the PAC or indirectly from other partner agencies that work with the PAC that provide would have or would have provided different sort of training.

49:22
Maybe you can tell me if there is any that's really focused that really focused on the soft skills.

49:27
So Filio, I think coming back to you, for example, you're a leader because you're responsible for the Rangers at KMPA.

49:39
So do you think you need, for example, leadership and management?

49:47
If do you have the the ability to influence or motivate or enable the Rangers on the youth, for example, to perform their duties?

50:09
Do you do you think that you need any sort of more capacity building in in in that area?

50:16
Or for example, another example of a soft skill that that they're looking at is motivation.

50:22
Are you a good motivator, for example, or Rangers, for example?

50:28
You're on the ground.

50:30
When you're when you're on the ground, there is no direct communication, for example, with head office.

50:37
Something happens and you have to react right the way.

50:41
Do you have the skills to be able to do problem solving and decision making and understanding what, for example, what that is like?

50:50
And yeah, so I thought that was one part that identified in the questionnaire as something that they need more training on.

51:01
So which one problem solving and conflict management Any So with the with the problem solving and the conflict management, because those are key.

51:21
I see that, I see that and you can you can correct me if I'm wrong.

51:24
I see that as you know, key skills in helping you to effectively perform your duties.

51:31
I've had some experience with consultations with communities, for example, I know that does not most recently, for example, consultations with the some of the communities around the KMPA and listening to some of the issues that they have and realizing that if you're not able to, to respond appropriately, you know that can that can lead to conflict.

52:02
So in Filio in suggesting that, is there any recommendations or suggestions on what you know that training could include?

52:16
So when we talk about problem solving and decision making and conflict resolution, any suggestions on, you know what the training program could could include officers or anyone else can, can can answer to?

52:44
We actually had a short one done through the through GFE project that was held in Georgetown and that was only for two days.

52:52
I think some something similar need to be done, probably more in depth and more involved in on the side coordinators from the different areas and there's a conflict resolution, conflict resolution and communication.

53:13
So more, yeah, more in depth.

53:18
Yeah, more in depth.

53:19
I turned it to the other was, was just kind of brush in the top of the criminal.

53:25
Probably more, more, more scenarios to deal with and more examples and directly to directly to us as as site coordinators.

53:40
So then OK, so for conflict for for conflict resolution because I think some of these modules may be things that can be done online.

53:53
So you know, you have those kind of online training that is offered on short term training that is offered on various, various things.

54:04
I think the idea in developing the trade, the soft skills training program for Rangers within the Amazon countries, I think some of it would be sort of like modules you go through that is done virtually.

54:22
Do you think that that would be enough for example or you need practical application?

54:29
No, I don't.

54:30
I don't.

54:30
I don't help.

54:31
Don't help.

54:40
OK, anyone else miss on my end?

54:56
Right.

54:57
I'm actually at least we don't really get a lot of well, we don't get conflict.

55:02
But however, I'm saying I feel a little bit of practical, you know, like a real life scenario would be much better rather than a virtual, just looking at the television, you know, 'cause most times practical actually plays the most important role rather than to you, to me, that's my personal No, I, I agree with you.

55:26
Being able to take what you learn in theory and being able to apply it in a real world situation does help.

55:36
And it, it the training would stick when you when you actually implemented in a real in a real world situation.

55:48
So I, I do agree.

55:50
Hi, I'm so sorry about that.

55:53
The Internet dropped here.

55:54
I'm actually on my data now.

55:57
That's OK.

55:59
Nope, no problem.

56:02
Rangers, What about rights, communities and communication?

56:08
So Alastair mentioned that there is not much conflict with the communities around the Shell Beach protected area.

56:17
But when we talk about rights and communities and communication, are you equipped to effectively communicate what needs to be communicated with the, ER, communities that you work with?

56:39
Being able to to to address or respond to concerns concerns raised by communities.

56:51
For example, maintaining good relations with the communities you work with.

57:13
Sorry, Alistair, can you can you repeat I was asking if you can repeat the question.

57:25
Oh, OK, sure.

57:27
So one of the other list of soft skill that that that is that could could be implemented.

57:40
It's talking about rights, communities and communication and what that base, what that basically means is are you Rangers equipped to effectively communicate with the communities you work with?

58:01
Being able to address issues that are raised by communities when you're on the ground and when you're doing, whether it's your quarterly, monthly, however often or whenever often you engage to keep the communities you work with and something comes up or there's a concern raised by, for example, somebody from the community.

58:27
Do you have the skill currently to be able to respond, but respond and and and be able to communicate in a way that that person or persons from the community understand?

58:44
Alice, I don't know if that is clear or do you need me to explain further?

58:55
No, it's fine.

58:56
I totally understand it from my end, talking to the locals within like that and the from the communities adjacent to the shell distributed area.

59:07
They they're very much when they explain something, it's easy to understand.

59:12
So all you have to do now when talking to them is that you have to use the Creole accent and you give them the info that and you know, you don't use big words and stuff.

59:22
They understand it.

59:25
Like the other day we went to the stakeholder community called manual they were talking about.

59:33
So yeah, they were talking about.

59:35
So it is possible alternatives concerning real life without activity.

59:40
So what?

59:42
And they can't be we I love the yeah, I'm going to use the local term.

59:48
So, you know, sometimes within the consultation you won't get you won't get what they're trying to tell you or they will be shy at school.

59:56
So when you put them in a corner, you don't, you know, you're like a normal person.

1:00:02
And then you get some of the most vital information and I feel that's something that we should be doing and you know, to get as much information as possible from these from these stakeholders community.

1:00:15
So one is concerned that the areas was they are fine.

1:00:21
So how can you find like, yeah, I could help you with the fish pond.

1:00:25
So it was like, what was my response?

1:00:27
I was like we from the PS we cannot help you directly what we were you have so you know right on your behalf of fisheries and we had a knowledge exchange 2 weeks with fisheries and we are representative.

1:00:41
So she's some I can't remember the program, but I remember Sophie.

1:00:45
So I told her about the, about the, the project that, you know, I explained all, everything, which I think that was good because from I, I received your information from the community and was able to hand this over to a person within the fish department.

1:01:04
I think I have the skill and I think more to my Rangers, I also have the skill, but we do need some training on that to enhance everyone's, you know, ability to, to communicate.

1:01:18
OK, So understanding the how you the rights, the rights based approach pre prior informed consent.

1:01:29
So, so that is still for example an area that that could be prioritized that you that you would prioritize in my opinion.

1:01:49
I will try prioritize here because the reason I will prioritize here isolation and conservationists, you know, we protect these people and within the village of Manwarian and Hyderabad, there we have the more the people that that actually active, active poachers.

1:02:07
So I feel when it comes to conservation, conservation comes with education and awareness, alternatives and poachers.

1:02:14
Because if you don't have poachers, you won't have conservation.

1:02:17
So when you have courses, now you have to run spread education and you have to give them a possible authority.

1:02:24
Because if you do look at it, fortune is the likelihood activity.

1:02:28
You cannot go and stop them from the likelihood activity without giving them, if possible, alternative.

1:02:34
And actually, so I fear prioritizing the village of Manwarin and assisting them with, you know, aquaculture and stuff.

1:02:42
It will, it will benefit us with our work and you will be more successful with the conservation aspect of this difficulties.

1:02:56
Well, thank you, Alistair.

1:02:57
So I, I, I agree, education communication is, is very important in, in any work, not just conservation, because it's, it's also being able to communicate clearly and effectively.

1:03:16
The idea is to not just in sharing information, but being able to open the channel to receive information as well.

1:03:25
So for example, looking at making sure that you understand that you need to also receive and receive information.

1:03:39
So active listening, not all of us are good listeners.

1:03:44
If you want, because communication is a 2 is there's two ways two way process anyone else?

1:04:14
Sorry Dionne, if you're trying to speak like not hearing you, Maybe it's the in the Internet connection.

1:04:24
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1:04:25
That's OK.

1:04:26
Strange to listen to Alice to the I didn't get any clear.

1:04:30
I don't know why would you like him to to repeat.

1:04:44
I just I can't get I can't get him clear.

1:04:46
He's been talking for the for the past couple minutes there and then, OK, if he we were, he was talking, we were talking about communication.

1:04:58
So rights communities and communication and how whether or not that's a soft skill, for example, you would prioritize.

1:05:06
So you would have given an example of session he had with a particular community and a particular community member.

1:05:18
So he said he did agree that this is one that he would prioritize or see see as important.

1:05:29
Yeah, I would agree with Alisa on that as well.

1:05:32
So we do a lot of going around different communities, around protected areas and we as we can, we communicate to different people in different communities and communication is amazing.

1:05:42
It's very important how we deliver our message and listen to them saying whatever is their concern.

1:05:50
And I think everybody except for the, we have some newcomers, they have a basic ID on the information that we supposed to give out.

1:06:00
But I think we did a little bit more on that.

1:06:02
Maybe we can build that so we can deliver it more effectively.

1:06:10
OK.

1:06:11
But I, I agreed because as Philio said as well that their new staff at the KMP as well, when we talk about communication is not only sharing, but it's also receiving, being able to handle different point of views, being able to be criticized.

1:06:32
Unfortunately, I've had the experience of attending consultations where PAC Rangers were very severely criticized.

1:06:41
Most complemented the CANPA Rangers do in taking it and being able to respond professionally.

1:06:53
So not understanding the different points of views and being able to respond in a way that does not create or in increase the situation.

1:07:16
Based on the the the list as well, is there any other because the idea is to also prioritize the the the need so the training needs for the Rangers here.

1:07:28
So the list I think in the questionnaire would have had about 11 proposed areas for soft skills building.

1:07:40
If you have to prioritize what would be your the, I guess that's maybe the top five priority capacity needs.

1:07:58
So what you've given what you've indicated so far, public speaking and communication, public speaking, communication and knowledge exchange.

1:08:08
So that covers I think about 3 or 4 of the soft skills listed or proposed.

1:08:20
You also mentioned conflict, conflict resolution.

1:08:25
So it's about I think 4 so far outside of what the Rangers from Shell Beach included as well by a walking GPS training that would fall and I think mostly technical.

1:08:45
But when we talk about the soft skills you those are the ones you so you would have listed so far.

1:08:53
Is there any other maybe the the list that was provided by the World Bank maybe did not include a particular skill that that that that is needed here.

1:09:04
Was there any for me?

1:09:14
I think one of the ones that really included here Diana was on a sudden the the different environmental laws that Philia are you still there?

1:09:32
Sorry I lost you.

1:09:33
I got you up to understanding the different environmental laws yes, so that we can call me getting me there.

1:09:45
I get thing, you know, I don't understand.

1:09:49
Yeah.

1:09:50
So that we can communicate to to our various stakeholders and all, but let them know that these these are the, the laws of the country.

1:09:58
And basically, you know, educate them on that.

1:10:03
OK, I'm actually making a list.

1:10:06
I'm making a list.

1:10:09
I have to separate them into, into soft skills and technical skills.

1:10:15
Just now you're making a list for me.

1:10:20
Yeah, probably mail it to your end.

1:10:22
I mean, I mean, maybe better.

1:10:25
Yeah.

1:10:25
So, yeah, you can, you can, you can e-mail it which helps as well.

1:10:29
Because in in, in putting together the priority soft skill needs for the Rangers here.

1:10:35
Of course we will share it with everyone.

1:10:37
So you agree that these are the you have prioritized these as the the capacity skills that you capacity building that you need.

1:10:50
So if you give it me and give it to me in writing failure, that helps.

1:10:54
That would help a lot, yes.

1:10:55
And if based on the list, if there was not any that was mentioned, you can include as well.

1:11:03
And also I do agree, while you can't have just technical skills, you need soft and vice versa, you cannot have you cannot only have soft skills.

1:11:13
You also need technical skills, so you can include that as well in, in, in if you've not already included included that.

1:11:29
So just I guess just a few more minutes because I do not want to.

1:11:33
The idea wasn't to have a long session, maximum one hour, but we did start about 10 minutes late.

1:11:42
But the idea was just to try to to have in, as I said earlier, in depth reflection on on your needs and your priorities.

1:11:54
So one of the other things they mentioned or are proposing is looking at the being able to communicate.

1:12:04
Let me get that right.

1:12:07
The natural and cultural values in in a protected area.

1:12:12
Now I know that I think most of our Rangers are capable of describing the natural and cultural values within a protected area because more, if not all, well all the Rangers are from areas in communities in close proximity to protect to the protected areas, correct?

1:12:48
So the answer yes, Julio, you or Alistair?

1:13:14
OK, So in in so you can explain so you can explain the cultural significance or the cultural value of the protected area that you that you work in.

1:13:25
What about the natural aspect of it?

1:13:28
So being able to talk about the importance for the importance in terms of what it does for climate, what it does for freshwater, for biodiversity as you are now, are you, do you have the, the, the skill or the capacity to communicate that effectively or you can, but there's still a room for support.

1:14:02
So why, why are, why is the Kanuku Mountains important?

1:14:07
Filio I've I've seen the PAC, the, the KNPA video and, and understanding that the communities there, the indigenous people within the surrounding the Kanuku Mountains, you know, this is our supermarket, as you have said, and they do understand the importance.

1:14:28
But in terms of you explaining from the point of view of the natural or the the ecosystem services protected areas provide.

1:14:37
So looking at the provision of freshwater climate regulation or even looking at explaining pollination, those kind of natural processes.

1:14:57
Or do you have you, you, you probably do that as you as anywhere in all your consultations with communities and on why the PA is important from from a natural point of view, from a cultural point of view.

1:15:14
Is there do you, is there a gap in that, in that particular scale considering you have new Rangers on your on your team as well?

1:15:26
Well, as I mentioned in the beginning, Diana, that we would have three different categories of staff here.

1:15:33
So I will, I will put it in, in my e-mail and take off with it.

1:15:39
The training will be needed across the board and we're as needed in the two categories or the third category.

1:15:45
I will do that just now, OK, because for for myself and probably the regions that are here for four and five years, they won't be able to do that.

1:16:00
But the, the, the newer employees, they, they would have the public speaking skills and the knowledge as yet to be able to impart it to our stakeholders.

1:16:12
OK, I think beyond you were going to say something.

1:16:24
I just same thing as Phil, you seen is like we have some newcomers, which is some of them are on right now.

1:16:31
But then there are some that could you know, really these stuff like the the natural resources, yeah, awards quite important.

1:16:43
But when it comes to the the younger ones or the new ones that come in, it might be challenging in a sense.

1:16:51
So I think that will be important as well.

1:16:57
OK, thank you for that.

1:16:59
So I would like to add to the point.

1:17:06
So when I consider SBP here, we indeed we have, we have new staff in which we, we actually, we have a, a portfolio with the biodiversity and this, you know, resources.

1:17:22
So in which they can we also give them.

1:17:25
Well, I personally with the instruction for my, for my site coordinator, Mr.

1:17:31
Rajan Kumar, I was able to, to facilitate a kind of some, some basic information, well, give information to these new readers.

1:17:42
I give them the portfolio and ensure that we read it and I also ensure that they present it to me in a, in a way that I can learn it.

1:17:51
You know, I, you know, I feel they're learning, but I, I still also feel that, you know, you should get additional help, you know, when it comes to them.

1:18:02
But they, they meet like the cultural and the natural, the natural benefits of the environmental for SVPA is very much straightforward.

1:18:10
And I think more strangers, they just have to do a little read up, you know, build their own capacity because actually there's a part of the job that they, they learn about these, these, these stuff within the their workplace.

1:18:25
So when it comes to like our staff spreading now, sometimes they might get the idea, but I think it's their, it's their, their responsibility to do additional reading.

1:18:42
OK.

1:18:47
Yes, ma'am.

1:18:49
Well, thank you.

1:18:50
Thank you for that.

1:18:51
So it seems that most of the Rangers at Shell Beach can describe the natural and cultural values of why Shell Beach was designated APA and why it is important.

1:19:11
OK.

1:19:12
So if we had to to back to prioritizing, if you had to prioritize the capacity the soft skill needs we have as I mentioned or or you, you would have mentioned public speaking and communication conflict resolution.

1:19:42
I think those are the, those are what, 3 or 4?

1:19:50
Or would you or would you discuss it among yourselves and, and or would it be easier for you to discuss it among yourselves and then you can share and share that which would be easier and more convenient for you because not all the the Rangers are here.

1:20:15
Which would you prefer?

1:20:26
I know Filio will send me the list that they have that he's working on.

1:20:31
And in that list, Filio, I assume that you will prioritize what you think are the ones that are highest priority for the Rangers at KMPA.

1:20:49
First of all, I put them in the two categories, right, the the technical skills and the soft skills and I put them in order of priority.

1:20:57
OK, great.

1:21:02
And the Rangers from Shell Beach, what would you prefer?

1:21:31
Yes, an idea of reaching it, our team including our supervisor to discuss on these topics and then bigger priorities from the UN.

1:21:44
So our site coordinator would be able to submit the OR going to be the number one priorities per second sort.

1:21:59
OK.

1:21:59
So just so OK, so just you will do just like the Rangers from KMPA and then we can we'll put together based on the discussions that we've had here.

1:22:11
We'll, I'll put together a short summary on, on the discussion and including what I received from from both KMPA and Shell Beach and then I will share that.

1:22:31
I, I will share that with you for any further inputs you may have or if, or if I miss anything, anything you'd want to include.

1:22:44
So I thought I think that that, or we've had a great discussion.

1:22:51
What what do you think?

1:22:57
Be honest, I think it was a good, good discussion.

1:23:02
And yeah, I would like to see these.

1:23:07
These though there will be will be prioritizing control.

1:23:13
So yes, possible.

1:23:13
So we can get on and going OK, well, the good thing is that the program, the, the, this is, this is the regional aspect of the program.

1:23:28
And it's more than likely that you will find similarities with what comes out of the of prioritizing the soft skills or the capacity needs.

1:23:39
And you I'm sure you'll see alignment with other countries and skills that that is needed here that is also needed by Rangers in Colombia or Peru.

1:23:53
So you will, while I can't say at this point whether or not all would be, you know, provided all the training on all that you prioritize will be provided, but for sure some if not all will be implemented.

1:24:16
Well, thank you for that.

1:24:17
I don't know if you if you if you, if you have any final comments or reflection from the discussion from the session or if you have any questions you'd want to ask me if if something wasn't clear or you need some information, some more information and something that would have that I would have mentioned.

1:24:42
Now is the time to ask, are the floors open to you?

1:24:46
OK, so the main focusing continue.

1:25:00
Sorry, just the main focus on this speech is just the focus on soft skills.

1:25:08
Yes, but there's no harm in also including because there are soft skill, there are soft skills that will go hand in hand with some technical with technical skills as well.

1:25:23
So for example, the the topic on or the proposed soft skill topic on being able to describe the natural and cultural values of a protected area.

1:25:36
So just like what I think Joy, I think would have mentioned earlier about the bio walk and being able to identify the species, for example, you encounter.

1:25:50
So that can that that can that is a technical skill as well as a soft skill, being able to identify and then being able to communicate that.

1:26:00
So if you see a particular species here, why is it here?

1:26:03
Is it important?

1:26:05
So I think you, you, you will have or you have overlaps between your technical skills and soft skills.

1:26:13
So if they are, when you have your discussion together and looking at soft skills and you see there's a need for a particular technical skills, you can also include that because the program is not only on soft skills and our capacity building is not only on soft skills.

1:26:35
The focus right now being prioritized is soft skills, but there is room to include, I do believe technical skills.

1:26:42
That's maybe the the program could also support, but even if it's not there, at least it's it's something that's been identified.

1:26:51
And whether it's, if it's not ASL, there is another could be some other project or program that could support the PAC and Rangers in being able to provide capacity building for those skills.

1:27:13
Where am I?

1:27:14
Where am I say said, you know the Rangers from the shelters big the year since we deal with the coastal area, we have had a lot of dealing with the ocean and so on.

1:27:24
So I think the skills like we come so far, seed training, sea survival training, it plays a critical role in carrying out our day-to-day activity on the beach or our job.

1:27:46
For sale and sea survival.

1:27:48
Yeah, sea survival training.

1:27:50
OK, I I'm talking a lot of that.

1:28:02
I have something similar to that today.

1:28:07
I know, but it'll be more advanced for us is for us.

1:28:12
But that's going to be included in the in the list also.

1:28:15
OK anyone else?

1:28:35
Ivan, I don't know if you want to see anything before we close.

1:28:52
Maybe she's not there.

1:28:54
Hey miss, Hi Alistair.

1:28:58
So I didn't get beyond too clear because my Internet jump bounced.

1:29:03
So all I heard is that he said we need force it, which I second.

1:29:10
I would like to 2nd that we also need to see survival.

1:29:14
We need it.

1:29:16
I, I, we spoke to it with our, because as, as you know, as you mentioned earlier, we're working at the coastal area.

1:29:23
I personally spoke, spoke to it, spoke about it with my site coordinator.

1:29:29
He, he related to head office and then the head office was planning to do a 4C training virtually, which I think in which I think it don't really, it won't benefit us because for say, there's something practical and I think that we need to get it in person.

1:29:51
Also the sea survival, the sea survival.

1:29:54
I, I, you know, I think we need it.

1:29:56
We need it to, you know, help help help the team in, in every aspect.

1:30:02
Because you can never know, you know, you never be too short of, since you're working in the ocean.

1:30:09
So it's good to be prepared.

1:30:13
I agree.

1:30:14
So I, I took note and in your discussions, you can also include that when you have your discussion.

1:30:20
So I, I did take note of what Dion mentioned.

1:30:30
I see there's thank you, Alistair.

1:30:33
Thank you, Dionne.

1:30:36
I guess Ivana is still having connection issues.

1:30:40
I see.

1:30:40
I sorry, I see.

1:30:41
We have we have a Ranger Laverne.

1:30:50
Could you introduce yourself?

1:30:52
I know we're we're almost at the end.

1:30:54
I do have one.

1:31:09
So Vern and I have Ranger Shell.

1:31:11
Oh, from Shell Beach as well.

1:31:12
OK.

1:31:16
All right.

1:31:17
Well, thank you all so much for taking the time to to to join the call and and in providing the feedback you have.

1:31:28
If there is any no other comment or questions for me, I can bring the meeting to an end.

1:31:39
Do know that this is, this is just the start and we will be, I will be in communication as we move forward with prioritizing the, the soft skill capacity needs based of course on your on your list and what you prioritize.

1:32:03
This will be discussed with the PAC as I mentioned at the start as well and we are going to have a focus group discussion with them as well on on the topics proposed by the World Bank and WCS.

1:32:24
Do also remember that that if there is, if there, if a particular skill is needed that was not listed or part of the list, you can include.

1:32:42
So there's no limits on or or or no restrictions on including something that was not that is not listed there.

1:32:51
If it if there's a need, if that is a need for you, if you have any questions or queries, you can always reach out.

1:33:06
PAC has my I can put my e-mail in the chat, so you can always reach out.

1:33:20
So let me just put that before.

1:33:35
So that's my e-mail.

1:33:36
If you have any questions or there's anything that was not clear and you don't want to ask now, you can always ask, always ask later.

1:33:52
So thank you all so much.

1:33:53
If there's nothing else, I can bring the meeting to a close and I will be in contact with you as we move forward and I look forward to receiving the the list from you all.

1:34:09
OK then.

1:34:10
Thank you very much.

1:34:13
Thank you all.

1:34:14
Take care.

1:34:15
Bye.

Atualmente ocupo a função de Chefe da RESEX Tapajós-Arapiuns (RTA). Com cerca de 20 mil habitantes, a RTA é a RESEX mais populosa do Brasil e a Unidade de Conservação mais populosa da Amazônia. Trata-se de um território com múltiplos atores com interesses diferentes. Possui múltiplas etnias indígenas com território sobreposto a UC (ex. Tupinambás, Kumaruaras e Munduruka Cara-preta) e milhares de outras famílias tradicionais ribeirinhas. Em uma UC tão populosa, os conflitos são frequentes, seja entre os beneficiários ou com usuários externos. Os desafios são frequentes e diários, com a equipe gestora tendo que administrar múltiplas situações envolvendo os múltiplos atores. Apenas no último semestre de 2023, administrei junto a equipe crises ligadas a incêndios nível 3 decorrentes do uso tradicional do fogo em roçados, conflitos sobre  a pesca entre indígenas e pescadores externos, distribuição de cerca de 5 mil cestas básicas em um território cujo acesso é exclusivamente fluvial (em pleno super El Niño na Amazônia). São múltiplas situações complexas que desafiam a equipe diariamente, principalmente a pessoa em posição de chefia. Como chefe e servidora, o preparo teórico e metodológico é um item de primeira necessidade. Assim, poderei atuar mais capacitada no sentido de continuar o trabalho de consolidação da UC, bem como de trabalhar para que as populações do território consigam perpetuar seu modo de vida tradicional associado a um território protegido.","Realizar diagnóstico a respeito da situação da gestão socioambiental nas UCs da Amazônia, mais especificamente com relação à gestão participativa por meio dos Conselhos gestores; gestão integrada de áreas de sobreposição territorial com territórios tradicionalmente ocupados; programas de educação ambiental; ações voltadas para a sociobioeconomia; etc.\r\n\r\nIdentificar estratégias de ação para fomentar ações positivas e enfrentar desafios nos territórios;\r\n\r\nRealizar capacitações nos temas mais importantes para gestores e comunitários;\r\n\r\nModerar espaços de gestão participativa de UCs;\r\n\r\nAnalisar documentos que garantam a participação social dos diversos segmentos da sociedade na gestão da UC;\r\n\r\nColaborar com a construção de acordos a respeito do uso dos recursos naturais e da biodiversidade pelos comunitários de populações tradicionais.","Trabalho na gestão de Uso Público no âmbito do bioma Amazônica, gerenciando as Unidades de Conservação do Acre, Rondônia e Sul do Amazonas, implementando o turismo ecológico na região.
